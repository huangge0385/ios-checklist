# To-do-list app
Delegate was used in ItemDetailViewController, ListDetailViewController etc. User experience is important, so NSUserDefaults was used to store message for further function when user leave and re-enter app. Data was handled with DataModel.m and DataModel.h. I did MVC in this way.

To sum up, the app has the following function:

1. Data was saved in Checklists-Info.plist
2. Add/Edit/Delete lists. 
3. Add/Edit/Delete Items.
4. Mark finished
5. Load the same page after re-enter app
6. Launch default list directly in the first time  
7. Save data when app enters background or app will be terminated
8. User friendly interface
